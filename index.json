The ability to withstand and recover from unexpected failures, including degradation of cloud provider services, can mean the difference between seamless operation and costly downtime. This is where the powerful combination of AWS Systems Manager (SSM) and AWS Fault Injection Service (AWS FIS) comes into play.\nFIS, launched in 2021, is a fully managed service designed to perform fault injection experiments on AWS workloads, improving reliability and resilience. While FIS provides built-in capabilities for simulating disruptive events, its integration with SSM opens a world of possibilities for creating custom, fine-grained fault injection experiments.\nIn this blog post, we’ll explore best practices for using SSM with FIS. We’ll delve into how this powerful duo can be leveraged to create more comprehensive and realistic chaos engineering experiments, going beyond the standard FIS actions to simulate a wider range of failure scenarios.\nThese testing techniques help ensure your critical applications—whether they’re custom-built solutions, enterprise systems like SAP, or web applications running on IIS—remain reliable and highly available. Using SSM, you can implement comprehensive application testing that goes beyond basic infrastructure checks to verify your entire application stack is performing as expected. This approach has helped organizations prevent service disruptions and deliver consistent experiences to their end users.\nAWS Fault Injection Service (FIS) overview FIS is a managed service that enables you to perform fault injection experiments on your AWS workloads. Fault injection is based on the principles of chaos engineering. These experiments stress an application by creating disruptive events so that you can observe how your application responds. You can then use this information to improve the performance and resiliency of your applications. With FIS, you set up and run experiments that help you create the real-world conditions needed to uncover application issues.\nAmazon Systems Manager – Run Command overview SSM helps you centrally view, manage, and operate instances at scale in AWS, on-premises, and multi-cloud environments. With the launch of a unified console experience, SSM consolidates various tools to help you complete common tasks across managed nodes (such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, edge devices, or on-premises servers) across AWS accounts and Regions.\nSSM’s Run Command lets you execute bash and PowerShell scripts across your entire fleet of systems—enabling everything from routine administrative tasks to complex configuration changes and even fault injection testing. This powerful capability works on any managed node, whether it’s an Amazon EC2 instance or a non-EC2 machine in your hybrid and multi-cloud environment. You can trigger these scripts through multiple interfaces, including the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS Tools for PowerShell, or AWS SDKs.\nIntegration overview FIS can execute fault injection experiments through Systems Manager using two actions: aws:ssm:send-command for SSM documents directly on EC2 instances, and aws:ssm:start-automation-execution for executing automation workflows. The send-command action is ideal for direct fault injection scenarios, while start-automation-execution is better suited for complex, multi-step fault injection experiments requiring orchestration. In this blog post, we’ll focus on using aws:ssm:send-command.\nFor direct command execution, AWS provides predefined fault injection documents (prefixed with AWSFIS) that handles common fault scenarios, like CPU spikes, disk consumption, memory leaks, and network packet loss. You can also create your own SSM Command documents containing custom fault injection logic that will be executed using the aws:ssm:send-command action.\nSSM Agent is Amazon software that can be installed and configured on EC2 instances, on-premises servers, or virtual machines (VMs). This makes it possible for Systems Manager to manage these resources. The agent processes requests from SSM and then runs them as specified in the request. The AWS Systems Manager Console example below shows the FIS documents.\nNote: The pre-configured SSM documents provided by FIS are supported only on EC2 instances. They are not supported on other types of managed nodes, such as on-premises servers.\nMore details on the AWSFIS documents can be found in the user guide. Figure 1: Fault Injection documents available within AWS Systems Manager\nBest practices – Systems Manager documents This section will cover best practices for implementing SSM documents for use with FIS. We will cover structure, parameter definition, OS detection, and preconditions.\nModular structure : Break down your documents into distinct, logical steps—similar to how AWS-managed documents typically separate dependency installation from script execution. This modular approach allows for independent failure handling, meaning if one step fails, you can isolate and address that specific issue without impacting other components. Each step can include its own cleanup actions, making it easier to roll back changes and return systems to a known good state when problems occur. The clear separation between steps also simplifies troubleshooting by helping you quickly pinpoint where issues arise, while well-defined modules can be reused across different automation documents. \u0026#34;mainSteps\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;aws:runPowerShellScript\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ValidatePrerequisites\u0026#34;, ... }, { \u0026#34;action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;aws:runPowerShellScript\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;StopIISAppPool\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stop specified IIS Application Pool\u0026#34;, ... }, { \u0026#34;action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;aws:runPowerShellScript\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;RestoreIISAppPool\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Restore IIS Application Pool to running state\u0026#34;, ... } ] Clear parameter definitions Clear parameter definitions: Parameters are defined with type, description, and often include default values and allowed patterns. Parameters are validated using allowedPattern or allowedValues to ensure correct input.\n\u0026#34;IISAppPoolName\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;String\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;DefaultAppPool\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Name of the Windows IIS Application Pool to Stop\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowedPattern\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,50}$\u0026#34; } Leverage environment variables for dynamic configuration: Always use SSM’s built-in environment variables (like AWS_SSM_REGION_NAME) instead of hardcoding values in your scripts. This practice ensures your automation remains portable across different regions and accounts, reduces the risk of errors from manual updates, and makes your documents more maintainable. For example, rather than embedding region-specific endpoints or paths, reference AWS_SSM_REGION_NAME to automatically adapt your scripts to whatever region they’re running in. You can view variables in your session by running an AWS Run Command for the AWS-RunShellScript document and pass the appropriate command for your OS. For example, pass printenv as a command to view environment variables on Linux.\nOS detection: Implement operating system detection to enable cross-platform automation. By identifying the OS type and version before executing any commands, you can properly handle the variations across different systems. This detect-then-execute pattern allows your automation to dynamically select the appropriate package manager (such as yum for Amazon Linux/CentOS or apt for Ubuntu), locate system files correctly, and use the right command line tools for each platform. This approach ensures your automation remains reliable and consistent whether you\u0026rsquo;re managing a homogeneous environment or a diverse fleet of Linux distributions.\nDetecting Amazon Linux if [ -f \u0026#34;/etc/system-release\u0026#34; ] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; grep -i \u0026#39;Amazon Linux\u0026#39; /etc/system-release ; then if ! grep -Fiq \u0026#39;VERSION_ID=\u0026#34;2023\u0026#34;\u0026#39; /etc/os-release ; then # Amazon Linux 2 or earlier yum -y install \u0026lt;package\u0026gt; elif grep -Fiq \u0026#39;ID=\u0026#34;amzn\u0026#34;\u0026#39; /etc/os-release \u0026amp;\u0026amp; grep -Fiq \u0026#39;VERSION_ID=\u0026#34;2023\u0026#34;\u0026#39; /etc/os-release ; then # Amazon Linux 2023 yum -y install \u0026lt;package\u0026gt; else echo \u0026#34;Exiting - This SSM document supports: Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS (7, Stream 8, Stream 9)\u0026#34; exit 1 fi fi Detecting CentOS/RHEL elif grep -Fiq \u0026#39;ID=\u0026#34;centos\u0026#34;\u0026#39; /etc/os-release || grep -Fiq \u0026#39;ID=\u0026#34;rhel\u0026#34;\u0026#39; /etc/os-release ; then # Fetch OS Version os_version_number=$(grep -oP \u0026#39;(?\u0026lt;=^VERSION_ID=).+\u0026#39; /etc/os-release | tr -d \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39;) # If the version has a decimal, this line will remove it os_major_version_number=${os_version_number%.*} # ... (EPEL repository setup) yum -y install \u0026lt;package\u0026gt; fi Preconditions: Create unified, intelligent automation by using preconditions in your SSM documents. Rather than maintaining separate Windows and Linux documents, write a single document that automatically executes the right commands for each platform. For example, your document can use ‘platformType’ preconditions to run PowerShell commands on Windows servers while executing bash scripts on Linux instances. You can also control workflow logic by using preconditions to check step completion—like verifying dependencies are installed before proceeding to configuration steps. This is done by setting a precondition that checks if a previous step completed successfully, for example, ‘StringEquals: InstallDependencies: True’. This approach ensures that steps execute in the correct order and only when previous requirements are met, while still maintaining platform-specific intelligence. The result is more reliable automation that works across your entire infrastructure, with built-in validation between steps. - action: aws:runShellScript name: InstallDependencies precondition: StringEquals: - platformType - Linux inputs: # step inputs - action: aws:runShellScript name: ConfigureApplication precondition: StringEquals: - \u0026#39;{{ InstallDependencies }}\u0026#39; - \u0026#39;True\u0026#39; inputs: # step inputs OnFailure: Handle the flow of execution in the document by leveraging the OnFailure field. OnFailure supports two values ‘exit’ or ‘successAndExit’. Both immediately stop processing any steps that haven’t been defined as a ‘finallyStep’. The difference between the two is that ‘exit’ will return a failure status, but successAndExit will return success. Since we are running these in the context of FIS, we want the failure to also fail the experiment. OnFailure: exit is also a good pattern to add to your prerequisites to ensure the target is ready to run the experiment. Here’s what the previous example looks like with the onFailure added. - action: aws:runShellScript name: InstallDependencies precondition: StringEquals: - platformType - Linux inputs: -\tonFailure: exit # step inputs Code best practices We will now look at what can we do within the SSM FIS code to ensure best practices at all layers of the automation. For additional SSM Run Command best practices, refer use cases and best practices.\nIdempotency: Implement idempotency in your scripts to ensure reliability and prevent unintended side effects during retries or repeated executions. This means your script must thoroughly check the current state of the system before making any changes and only perform actions when necessary. For example, before installing software, verify if it’s already installed and at the correct version; before modifying configurations, confirm they aren’t already at the desired state. Design your scripts to handle interrupted executions gracefully by implementing state tracking mechanisms (such as status files or SSM Parameter Store entries) that record progress and allow subsequent runs to pick up where they left off. # Check if experiment is already running if (Test-Path -Path \u0026#39;C:\\temp\\fis_windows_iis_experiment.json\u0026#39;) { Write-Host \u0026#34;ERROR: fis_windows_iis_experiment.json already exists. Exiting.\u0026#34; Exit 1 } # Verify service exists before attempting operations if (-not (Get-IISAppPool -Name {{IISAppPoolName}} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) { Write-Host \u0026#34;ERROR: Application Pool {{IISAppPoolName}} not found\u0026#34; Exit 1 } Timeouts: Set appropriate timeouts in your automation steps to enforce operational safety and enable proper error handling. Each step should include a ‘timeoutSeconds’ parameter that reflects both the expected execution time and your tolerance for delayed completion. This timeout acts as a critical safety mechanism—when a step exceeds its timeout, Systems Manager will terminate the execution and trigger cleanup procedures. This approach ensures your automation doesn’t leave systems in an unknown state during failures. For example, if a software installation step times out, your script should include cleanup logic to roll back any partial changes, such as removing incomplete installations or restoring original configurations. By combining timeouts with proper cleanup procedures, you maintain system integrity even when the control structure around your scripts fails or become unresponsive. Example from the AWSFIS-Run-CPU-Stress. - action: aws:runShellScript name: StopService inputs: timeoutSeconds: 60 runCommand: - | #!/bin/bash # script content here ################################# # General post fault-execution logic # ################################# DURATION={{ DurationSeconds }} if [[ -z $start_time ]];then \u0026gt;\u0026amp;2 echo \u0026#34;start_time is not defined\u0026#34; exit 1; fi elapsed_time=$(( $(date +%s) - start_time )) # Fail if the fault command exits successfully but the execution duration is less than the expected duration. # This happens when Stress-ng is killed prematurely using SIGTERM or SIGINT. if [[ \u0026#34;$elapsed_time\u0026#34; -lt \u0026#34;$DURATION\u0026#34; ]]; then \u0026gt;\u0026amp;2 echo \u0026#34;Fault took $elapsed_time seconds to execute, which is less than expected duration $DURATION\u0026#34; exit 1; fi Logging: Scripts should include echo statements to log progress and the result of the Run command SSM document. Command output can be viewed in a number of ways and is useful for debugging the document as well as recording success messages throughout the duration of the execution. Output options can be configured as part of the Run Command, logging can be viewed by navigating to the command history in SSM, or via Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or Amazon CloudWatch logs. Note that additional configuration steps are required for setting up the S3 bucket logging and/or CloudWatch logs. Also, logging can be redirected to the local OS /tmp location which may be valuable in more complex scenarios. function Write-Log { param($Message) $timestamp = Get-Date -Format \u0026#39;yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\u0026#39; Write-Host \u0026#34;[$timestamp] $Message\u0026#34; } # Logging example Write-Log \u0026#34;Stopping IIS Application Pool: {{IISAppPoolName}}\u0026#34; # Rollback implementation try { Write-Log \u0026#34;Restoring IIS Application Pool: {{IISAppPoolName}}\u0026#34; Start-WebAppPool -Name {{IISAppPoolName}} $startedPool = Get-IISAppPool -Name {{IISAppPoolName}} if ($startedPool.State -ne \u0026#39;Started\u0026#39;) { throw \u0026#34;Failed to start application pool\u0026#34; } } catch { Write-Log \u0026#34;ERROR during restoration: $($_.Exception.Message)\u0026#34; throw } Output options can be configured in AWS Systems Manager \u0026gt; Node Tools \u0026gt; Run Command\nFigure 2: Output Options\nRun command output can be viewed after a job is run by navigating to “Command history” and choosing “View output”\nFigure 3: – Output from run command\nCleanup Procedures: As idempotency is a desired characteristic, we must clean up once we have completed our impairment to allow for the experiment to be re-ran. Implement cleanup procedures to remove temporary files, restore service configurations, and reset system states to their original condition. Your cleanup routines should be as thorough as your setup procedures, ensuring that each experiment truly starts from a clean slate. This includes removing any temporary files, restoring original configuration files, clearing cached data, and verifying service states. Always implement proper error handling and logging during cleanup, as failed cleanup procedures can compromise the idempotency of future experiment runs. # Windows (IIS) Cleanup Example try { Write-Log \u0026#34;Cleaning up: Deleting JSON file C:\\\\temp\\\\fis_windows_iis_experiment.json\u0026#34; Remove-Item -Path C:\\\\temp\\\\fis_windows_iis_experiment.json -Force Write-Log \u0026#34;JSON file deleted successfully\u0026#34; } catch { Write-Log \u0026#34;ERROR during cleanup: $($_.Exception.Message)\u0026#34; throw } # Linux (HTTPD) Cleanup Example echo \u0026#39;Cleaning up: Deleting /tmp/fis_linux_service_experiment.json\u0026#39; rm -f /tmp/fis_linux_service_experiment.json echo \u0026#39;JSON file deleted successfully.\u0026#39; Service State Restoration: Your FIS experiment will stress an application in testing or production environments by creating disruptive events. As chaos testing matures into production environments, it’s critical to implement checks to ensure services are properly restored. # Windows (IIS) Service Restoration try { Write-Log \u0026#34;Restoring IIS Application Pool: {{IISAppPoolName}}\u0026#34; Start-WebAppPool -Name {{IISAppPoolName}} $startedPool = Get-IISAppPool -Name {{IISAppPoolName}} if ($startedPool.State -ne \u0026#39;Started\u0026#39;) { throw \u0026#34;Failed to start application pool\u0026#34; } Write-Log \u0026#34;Application Pool restored successfully\u0026#34; } catch { Write-Log \u0026#34;ERROR during restoration: $($_.Exception.Message)\u0026#34; throw } # Linux (HTTPD) Service Restoration echo \u0026#39;Restoring service {{ServiceName}}\u0026#39; sudo systemctl start {{ServiceName}} if ! systemctl is-active --quiet {{ServiceName}}; then echo \u0026#39;ERROR: Failed to start service {{ServiceName}}\u0026#39; exit 1 fi echo \u0026#39;Service restored successfully.\u0026#39; Duration Management: Proper rollback includes managing experiment duration and ensuring timely restoration. As chaos engineering practices evolve, timing of the experiment will become more precise. Other factors may come into play as part of the experiment depending on architecture being tested; for example, dynamic scaling methods may be in place for Auto Scaling Groups. Refer planning your AWS FIS experiments for more details. # Windows Duration Management $elapsed_time = ((Get-Date) - $start_time).TotalSecondsWrite-Log \u0026#34;Elapsed time: $elapsed_time seconds\u0026#34; $remaining_time = {{DurationSeconds}} - $elapsed_time if ($remaining_time -gt 0) { Write-Log \u0026#34;Waiting for remaining time: $remaining_time seconds before restart\u0026#34; Start-Sleep -Seconds $remaining_time } # Linux Duration Management elapsed_time=$((current_time_epoch - start_time_epoch)) remaining_time=$(( {{DurationSeconds}} - elapsed_time ))if [ $remaining_time -gt 0 ]; then echo \u0026#34;Waiting for remaining time: $remaining_time seconds before restart\u0026#34; sleep $remaining_time fi Error Handling During Rollback: Implement comprehensive error handling during rollback operations. As part of the fault experiment, tests should include verbose error handling to aid in debugging and simplifying the ongoing journey of Chaos Engineering. Teams should take a continuous approach to resilience in the cloud, responding and learning based on success and failure of previous experiments. Refer to the Resilience lifecycle framework for more guidance on resilience best practices and continuous improvement. # Windows Error Handling try { # Restoration logic } catch { Write-Log \u0026#34;ERROR: Rollback failed - $($_.Exception.Message)\u0026#34; Write-Log \u0026#34;Manual intervention may be required\u0026#34; throw } finally { # Cleanup that must happen regardless of success/failure if (Test-Path -Path \u0026#39;C:\\temp\\fis_windows_iis_experiment.json\u0026#39;) { Remove-Item -Path C:\\temp\\fis_windows_iis_experiment.json -Force } } Conclusion Systems Manager and Fault Injection Service provide a powerful platform for implementing chaos engineering principles and improving the resilience of your AWS workloads. By following the best practices outlined in this blog, you can create more robust, efficient, and maintainable SSM documents for use with FIS. Key takeaways include implementing a modular structure, proper parameter management, OS detection, comprehensive error handling and logging, robust rollback mechanisms, effective timeout management, and proper signal handling. Additionally, utilizing preconditions, adhering to security best practices, and thorough testing are crucial for creating effective chaos engineering experiments.\nAs you continue to leverage SSM and FIS in your AWS environments, remember that chaos engineering is an ongoing process.

For instance, generative AI can be used to perform text summarization, facilitate personalized marketing strategies, create business-critical chat-based assistants, and so on. However, as generative AI adoption grows, associated costs can escalate in several areas including cost in inference, deployment, and model customization. Effective cost optimization can help to make sure that generative AI initiatives remain financially sustainable and deliver a positive return on investment. Proactive cost management makes the best of generative AI’s transformative potential available to businesses while maintaining their financial health.\nAmazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, DeepSeek, Luma, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using Amazon Bedrock, you can experiment with and evaluate top FMs for your use case, privately customize them with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and build agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources.\nWith the increasing adoption of Amazon Bedrock, optimizing costs is a must to help keep the expenses associated with deploying and running generative AI applications manageable and aligned with your organization’s budget. In this post, you’ll learn about strategic cost optimization techniques while using Amazon Bedrock.\nUnderstanding Amazon Bedrock pricing Amazon Bedrock offers a comprehensive pricing model based on actual usage of FMs and related services. The core pricing components include model inference (available in On-Demand, Batch, and Provisioned Throughput options), model customization (charging for training, storage, and inference), and Custom Model Import (free import but charges for inference and storage). Through Amazon Bedrock Marketplace, you can access over 100 models with varying pricing structures for proprietary and public models. You can check out Amazon Bedrock pricing for a pricing overview and more details on pricing models.\nCost monitoring in Amazon Bedrock You can monitor the cost of your Amazon Bedrock usage using the following approaches:\nApplication inference profiles – Amazon Bedrock provides application inference profiles that you can use to apply custom cost allocation tags to track, manage, and control on-demand FM costs and usage across different workloads and tenants. Cost allocation tagging – You can tag all Amazon Bedrock models, aligning usage to specific organizational taxonomies such as cost centers, business units, teams, and applications for precise expense tracking. To carry out tagging operations, you need the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource on which you want to carry out a tagging operation. Integration with AWS cost tools – Amazon Bedrock cost monitoring integrates with AWS Budgets, AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Cost and Usage Reports, and AWS Cost Anomaly Detection, enabling organizations to set tag-based budgets, receive alerts for usage thresholds, and detect unusual spending patterns Amazon CloudWatch metrics monitoring – Organizations can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor runtime metrics for Amazon Bedrock applications by inference profile, set alarms based on thresholds, and receive notifications for real-time management of resource usage and costs. You can monitor all parts of your Amazon Bedrock application using Amazon CloudWatch, which collects raw data and processes it into readable, near real-time metrics. You can graph the metrics using the AWS Management Console for CloudWatch. You can also set alarms that watch for certain thresholds and send notifications or take action when values exceed those thresholds. Resource-specific visibility – CloudWatch provides metrics such as Invocations, InvocationLatency, InputTokenCount, OutputTokenCount, and various error metrics that can be filtered by model IDs and other dimensions for granular monitoring of Amazon Bedrock usage and performance. Cost optimization strategies for Amazon Bedrock When building generative AI applications with Amazon Bedrock, implementing thoughtful cost optimization strategies can significantly reduce your expenses while maintaining application performance. In this section, you’ll find key approaches to consider in the following order:\nSelect the appropriate model Determine if it needs customization a. If yes, explore options in the correct order b. If no, proceed to the next step Perform prompt engineering and management Design efficient agents Select the correct consumption option This flow is shown in the following flow diagram. Choose an appropriate model for your use case Amazon Bedrock provides access to a diverse portfolio of FMs through a single API. The service continually expands its offerings with new models and providers, each with different pricing structures and capabilities.\nFor example, consider the on-demand pricing variation among Amazon Nova models in the US East (Ohio) AWS Region. This pricing is current as of May 21, 2025. Refer to the Amazon Bedrock pricing page for latest data.\nAs shown in the following table, the price varies significantly between Amazon Nova Micro, Amazon Nova Lite, and Amazon Nova Pro models. For example, Amazon Nove Micro is approximately 1.71 times cheaper than Amazon Note Lite based on per 1,000 input tokens as of this writing. If you don’t need multimodal capability and the accuracy of Amazon Nova Micro meets your use case, then you need not opt for Amazon Nova Lite. This demonstrates why selecting the right model for your use case is critical. The largest or most advanced model isn’t always necessary for every application.\nAmazon Nova models Price per 1,000 input tokens Price per 1,000 output tokens Amazon Nova Micro $0.000035 $0.00014 Amazon Nova Lite $0.00006 $0.00024 Amazon Nova Pro $0.0008 $0.0032 One of the key advantages of Amazon Bedrock is its unified API, which abstracts the complexity of working with different models. You can switch between models by changing the model ID in your request with minimal code modifications. With this flexibility, you can select the most cost and performance optimized model that meets your requirements and upgrade only when necessary.\nBest practice: Use Amazon Bedrock native features to evaluate the performance of the foundation model for your use case. Begin with an automatic model evaluation job to narrow down the scope. Follow it up by using LLM as a judge or human-based evaluation as required for your use case. Perform model customization in the right order When customizing FMs in Amazon Bedrock for contextualizing responses, choosing the strategy in correct order can significantly reduce your expenses while maximizing performance. You have four primary strategies available, each with different cost implications:\n1.Prompt Engineering – Start by crafting high-quality prompts that effectively condition the model to generate desired responses. This approach requires minimal resources and no additional infrastructure costs beyond your standard inference calls. 2.RAG – Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases is a fully managed feature with built-in session context management and source attribution that helps you implement the entire RAG workflow from ingestion to retrieval and prompt augmentation without having to build custom integrations to data sources and manage data flows. 3.Fine-tuning – This approach involves providing labeled training data to improve model performance on specific tasks. Although its effective, fine-tuning requires additional compute resources and creates custom model versions with associated hosting costs. 4.Continued pre-training – The most resource-intensive option involves providing unlabeled data to further train an FM on domain-specific content. This approach incurs the highest costs and longest implementation time.\nThe following graph shows the escalation of the complexity, quality, cost, and time of these four approaches. Best practice: Implement these strategies progressively. Begin with prompt engineering as your foundation—it’s cost-effective and can often deliver impressive results with minimal investment. Refer to the Optimize for clear and concise prompts section to learn about different strategies that you can follow to write good prompts. Next, integrate RAG when you need to incorporate proprietary information into responses. These two approaches together should address most use cases while maintaining efficient cost structures. Explore fine-tuning and continued pre-training only when you have specific requirements that can’t be addressed through the first two methods and your use case justifies the additional expense.\nBy following this implementation hierarchy, shown in the following figure, you can optimize both your Amazon Bedrock performance and your budget allocation. Here is the high-level mental model for choosing different options:\nUse Amazon Bedrock native model distillation feature Amazon Bedrock Model Distillation is a powerful feature that you can use to access smaller, more cost-effective models without sacrificing performance and accuracy for your specific use cases.\nEnhance accuracy of smaller (student) cost-effective models – With Amazon Bedrock Model Distillation, you can select a teacher model whose accuracy you want to achieve for your use case and then select a student model that you want to fine-tune. Model distillation automates the process of generating responses from the teacher and using those responses to fine-tune the student model. Maximize distilled model performance with proprietary data synthesis – Fine-tuning a smaller, cost-efficient model to achieve accuracy similar to a larger model for your specific use case is an iterative process. To remove some of the burden of iteration needed to achieve better results, Amazon Bedrock Model Distillation might choose to apply different data synthesis methods that are best suited for your use case. For example, Amazon Bedrock might expand the training dataset by generating similar prompts, or it might generate high-quality synthetic responses using customer provided prompt-response pairs as golden examples. Reduce cost by bringing your production data – With traditional fine-tuning, you’re required to create prompts and responses. With Amazon Bedrock Model Distillation, you only need to provide prompts, which are used to generate synthetic responses and fine-tune student models. Best practice: Consider model distillation when you have a specific, well-defined use case where a larger model performs well but costs more than desired. This approach is particularly valuable for high-volume inference scenarios where the ongoing cost savings will quickly offset the initial investment in distillation. Use Amazon Bedrock intelligent prompt routing With Amazon Bedrock Intelligent Prompt Routing, you can now use a combination of FMs from the same model family to help optimize for quality and cost when invoking a model. For example, you can route between the Anthropic’s Claude model family—between Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Haiku depending on the complexity of the prompt. This is particularly useful for applications like customer service assistants, where uncomplicated queries can be handled by smaller, faster, and more cost-effective models, and complex queries are routed to more capable models. Intelligent prompt routing can reduce costs by up to 30% without compromising on accuracy.\nBest practice: Implement intelligent prompt routing for applications that handle a wide range of query complexities.\nOptimize for clear and concise prompts Optimizing prompts for clarity and conciseness in Amazon Bedrock focuses on structured, efficient communication with the model to minimize token usage and maximize response quality. Through techniques such as clear instructions, specific output formats, and precise role definitions, you can achieve better results while reducing costs associated with token consumption.\nStructured instructions – Break down complex prompts into clear, numbered steps or bullet points. This helps the model follow a logical sequence and improves the consistency of responses while reducing token usage. Output specifications – Explicitly define the desired format and constraints for the response. For example, specify word limits, format requirements, or use indicators like Please provide a brief summary in 2-3 sentences to control output length. Avoid redundancy – Remove unnecessary context and repetitive instructions. Keep prompts focused on essential information and requirements because superfluous content can increase costs and potentially confuse the model. Use separators – Employ clear delimiters (such as triple quotes, dashes, or XML-style tags) to separate different parts of the prompt to help the model to distinguish between context, instructions, and examples. Role and context precision – Start with a clear role definition and specific context that’s relevant to the task. For example, You are a technical documentation specialist focused on explaining complex concepts in simple terms provides better guidance than a generic role description. Best practice: Amazon Bedrock offers a fully managed feature to optimize prompts for a select model. This helps to reduce costs by improving prompt efficiency and effectiveness, leading to better results with fewer tokens and model invocations. The prompt optimization feature automatically refines your prompts to follow best practices for each specific model, eliminating the need for extensive manual prompt engineering that could take months of experimentation. Use this built-in prompt optimization feature in Amazon Bedrock to get started and optimize further to get better results as needed. Experiment with prompts to make them clear and concise to reduce the number of tokens without compromising the quality of the responses. Optimize cost and performance using Amazon Bedrock prompt caching You can use prompt caching with supported models on Amazon Bedrock to reduce inference response latency and input token costs. By adding portions of your context to a cache, the model can use the cache to skip recomputation of inputs, enabling Amazon Bedrock to share in the compute savings and lower your response latencies.\nSignificant cost reduction – Prompt caching can reduce costs by up to 90% compared to standard model inference costs, because cached tokens are charged at a reduced rate compared to non-cached input tokens. Ideal use cases – Prompt caching is particularly valuable for applications with long and repeated contexts, such as document Q\u0026amp;A systems where users ask multiple questions about the same document or coding assistants that maintain context about code files. Improved latency – Implementing prompt caching can decrease response latency by up to 85% for supported models by eliminating the need to reprocess previously seen content, making applications more responsive. Cache retention period – Cached content remains available for up to 5 minutes after each access, with the timer resetting upon each successful cache hit, making it ideal for multiturn conversations about the same context. Implementation approach – To implement prompt caching, developers identify frequently reused prompt portions, tag these sections using the cachePoint block in API calls, and monitor cache usage metrics (cacheReadInputTokenCount and cacheWriteInputTokenCount) in response metadata to optimize performance. Best practice: Prompt caching is valuable in scenarios where applications repeatedly process the same context, such as document Q\u0026amp;A systems where multiple users query the same content. The technique delivers maximum benefit when dealing with stable contexts that don’t change frequently, multiturn conversations about identical information, applications that require fast response times, high-volume services with repetitive requests, or systems where cost optimization is critical without sacrificing model performance. Cache prompts within the client application Client-side prompt caching helps reduce costs by storing frequently used prompts and responses locally within your application. This approach minimizes API calls to Amazon Bedrock models, resulting in significant cost savings and improved application performance.\nLocal storage implementation – Implement a caching mechanism within your application to store common prompts and their corresponding responses, using techniques such as in-memory caching (Redis, Memcached) or application-level caching systems. Cache hit optimization – Before making an API call to Amazon Bedrock, check if the prompt or similar variations exist in the local cache. This reduces the number of billable API calls to the FMs, directly impacting costs. You can check Caching Best Practices to learn more. Expiration strategy – Implement a time-based cache expiration strategy such as Time To Live (TTL) to help make sure that cached responses remain relevant while maintaining cost benefits. This aligns with the 5-minute cache window used by Amazon Bedrock for optimal cost savings. Hybrid caching approach – Combine client-side caching with the built-in prompt caching of Amazon Bedrock for maximum cost optimization. Use the local cache for exact matches and the Amazon Bedrock cache for partial context reuse. Cache monitoring – Implement cache hit:miss ratio monitoring to continually optimize your caching strategy and identify opportunities for further cost reduction through cached prompt reuse. Best practice: In performance-critical systems and high-traffic websites, client-side caching enhances response times and user experience while minimizing dependency on ongoing Amazon Bedrock API interactions. Build small and focused agents that interact with each other rather than a single large monolithic agent Creating small, specialized agents that interact with each other in Amazon Bedrock can lead to significant cost savings while improving solution quality. This approach uses the multi-agent collaboration capability of Amazon Bedrock to build more efficient and cost-effective generative AI applications.\nThe multi-agent architecture advantage: You can use Amazon Bedrock multi-agent collaboration to orchestrate multiple specialized AI agents that work together to tackle complex business problems. By creating smaller, purpose-built agents instead of a single large one, you can:\nOptimize model selection based on specific tasks – Use more economical FMs for simpler tasks and reserve premium models for complex reasoning tasks Enable parallel processing – Multiple specialized agents can work simultaneously on different aspects of a problem, reducing overall response time Improve solution quality – Each agent focuses on its specialty, leading to more accurate and relevant responses Best practice: Select appropriate models for each specialized agent, matching capabilities to task requirements while optimizing for cost. Based on the complexity of the task, you can choose either a low-cost model or a high-cost model to optimize the cost. Use AWS Lambda functions that retrieve only the essential data to reduce unnecessary cost in Lambda execution. Orchestrate your system with a lightweight supervisor agent that efficiently handles coordination without consuming premium resources. Choose the desired throughput depending on the usage Amazon Bedrock offers two distinct throughput options, each designed for different usage patterns and requirements:\nOn-Demand mode – Provides a pay-as-you-go approach with no upfront commitments, making it ideal for early-stage proof of concepts (POCs) on development and test environments, applications with unpredictable or seasonal or sporadic traffic with significant variation. With On-Demand pricing, you’re charged based on actual usage:\nText generation models – Pay per input token processed and output token generated Embedding models – Pay per input token processed Image generation models – Pay per image generated Provisioned Throughput mode – By using Provisioned Throughput, you can purchase dedicated model units for specific FMs to get higher level of throughput for a model at a fixed cost. This makes Provisioned Throughput suitable for production workload requiring predictable performance without throttling. If you customized a model, you must purchase Provisioned Throughput to be able to use it. Each model unit delivers a defined throughput capacity measured by the maximum number of tokens processed per minute. Provisioned Throughput is billed hourly with commitment options of 1-month or 6-month terms, with longer commitments offering greater discounts.\nBest practice: If you’re working on a POC or on a use case that has a sporadic workload using one of the base FMs from Amazon Bedrock, use On-Demand mode to take the benefit of pay-as-you-go pricing. However, if you’re working on a steady state workload where throttling must be avoided, or if you’re using custom models, you should opt for provisioned throughput that matches your workload. Calculate your token processing requirements carefully to avoid over-provisioning.\nUse batch inference With batch mode, you can get simultaneous large-scale predictions by providing a set of prompts as a single input file and receiving responses as a single output file. The responses are processed and stored in your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket so you can access them later. Amazon Bedrock offers select FMs from leading AI providers like Anthropic, Meta, Mistral AI, and Amazon for batch inference at a 50% lower price compared to On-Demand inference pricing. Refer to Supported AWS Regions and models for batch inference for more details. This approach is ideal for non-real-time workloads where you need to process large volumes of content efficiently.\nBest practice: Identify workloads in your application that don’t require real-time responses and migrate them to batch processing. For example, instead of generating product descriptions on-demand when users view them, pre-generate descriptions for new products in a nightly batch job and store the results. This approach can dramatically reduce your FM costs while maintaining the same output quality.\nConclusion As organizations increasingly adopt Amazon Bedrock for their generative AI applications, implementing effective cost optimization strategies becomes crucial for maintaining financial efficiency. The key to successful cost optimization lies in taking a systematic approach. That is, start with basic optimizations such as proper model selection and prompt engineering, then progressively implement more advanced techniques such as caching and batch processing as your use cases mature.

Amazon Cognito is AWS’s fully managed identity service that provides:\nUser sign-up \u0026amp; sign-in (email/password, social logins, SAML/OIDC) Built-in email/phone verification Multi-factor authentication (MFA) User directory with custom attributes and groups Secure JWT tokens (ID token, access token, refresh token) Scales automatically to millions of users Free tier: 50,000 monthly active users In this workshop, we use Cognito User Pools as our secure backend identity provider.\nWhat is AWS Amplify (Gen 2 / v6+)? AWS Amplify is the official AWS toolkit for frontend and mobile developers.\nThe new Amplify Gen 2 library (v6+) released in 2024–2025 is completely rewritten and is now:\nTree-shakable (only import what you use) Fully SSR-compatible (ssr: true) Designed specifically for Next.js App Router \u0026amp; React Server Components No more @aws-amplify/ui-react or Hosted UI required Uses the new modular @aws-amplify/auth, @aws-amplify/datastore, etc. We will use only the Auth category of Amplify Gen 2 — the cleanest, most secure, and most modern way to connect a Next.js app to Cognito.\nWhy Use Cognito + Amplify Gen 2 Together in 2025? Benefit Explanation Rapid \u0026amp; Secure Development Amplify abstracts all token handling, refresh logic, and Cognito API calls SSR \u0026amp; App Router Ready Works perfectly with ssr: true → no hydration errors, no window is not defined No Client Secret Public SPA client (no secret needed) → safe for Next.js \u0026amp; Vercel Production-Grade Security Tokens never touch localStorage on server, automatic refresh, secure by default Role-Based Access Uses Cognito Groups → cognito:groups in ID token → easy admin/user detection Deploy Anywhere Works flawlessly on Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify Hosting, CloudFront + S3 Future-Proof This is the official AWS-recommended pattern from 2024 onward What You Will Build (Exact Outcome) A complete Next.js 14 (App Router) application with:\nSign-up → automatic email verification code Sign-in → protected dashboard Global AuthContext + useAuth() hook ProtectedRoute component Clean, modern UI using shadcn/ui Zero security anti-patterns Ready? You are now exactly on the same path that AWS solutions architects, startups, and enterprises use daily in 2025.\nNext Step: 5.2 Prerequisites → Set up your AWS account, Node.js, and development environment\n"},{"uri":"https://thormastran.github.io/fcj-workshop-template/5-workshop/5.5-cognito-function/5.5.2-auth-ui/","title":"Build Authentication UI","tags":[],"description":"","content":"5.5.2 Build Authentication UI 100% faithful to your original workshop — beautiful, functional, production-grade\nYou now have all the Cognito logic.

Executive Summary Rafilm is a Letterboxd-inspired movie logging and recommendation platform designed to help general users track their watched films, share reviews, and discover new favorites through AI-powered recommendations. Built as part of the AWS First Cloud Journey (FCJ) internship, Rafilm integrates Amazon Personalize and Bedrock to deliver tailored movie suggestions and conversational recommendations via a chatbot interface.\nThe platform runs fully on AWS Serverless architecture, featuring Amplify-hosted Next.js frontend, Lambda-based backend services connected through API Gateway, and DynamoDB for scalable user and movie data storage. TMDb provides external movie data integration, while Amazon Cognito manages user authentication. Rafilm aims to demonstrate a scalable, intelligent, and cost-efficient architecture capable of supporting multi-user access and interactive experiences.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? While existing movie platforms like Letterboxd and IMDb offer robust logging and social features, they lack personalized recommendation systems and interactive discovery experiences. Users often rely on external sources or generic trending lists to find what to watch next, leading to irrelevant or repetitive suggestions.\nThe Solution Rafilm integrates a custom recommendation pipeline powered by Amazon Personalize, combined with a Bedrock LLM chatbot that interprets user preferences and generates conversational movie recommendations. Users can log movies, write reviews, and receive curated suggestions—all within one seamless experience. Unlike Letterboxd, Rafilm focuses on data-driven personalization and AI-assisted interaction rather than pure social networking.\nBenefits and Return on Investment By leveraging AWS Serverless services, Rafilm achieves near-zero maintenance cost, pay-per-use scalability, and real-time AI-driven personalization. For the FCJ internship, the project serves as both a technical showcase and a learning artifact for integrating AI services in serverless architectures. Projected cost remains under $1/month during testing, with AWS Free Tier coverage for most usage.\n3. Solution Architecture Rafilm employs a modular serverless architecture using AWS services for scalability, integration, and cost optimization.\nAWS Services Used AWS Amplify: Hosts the Next.js frontend for movie browsing, logging, and chatbot interaction. Amazon Cognito: Handles user registration, login, and session management. Amazon API Gateway: Routes client requests to backend Lambda functions. AWS Lambda: Executes serverless business logic (e.g., CRUD for reviews, fetching TMDb data, triggering recommendations). Amazon DynamoDB: Stores user logs, movie interactions, and preferences. Amazon Personalize: Trains and serves personalized recommendation models. Amazon Bedrock: Provides conversational chatbot functionality for recommendation dialogue. Amazon S3: Stores static assets and backups for logs and model outputs. Component Design Frontend (Next.js): User-friendly interface for movie discovery, logging, and chat-based recommendations. Backend (Lambda + API Gateway): Stateless logic layer handling user operations, movie fetching, and recommendation retrieval. Data Layer (DynamoDB + S3): Stores structured user interactions and movie metadata for model training. AI Layer (Personalize + Bedrock): Personalize analyzes historical user interactions; Bedrock chatbot provides natural language access to personalized results. Authentication (Cognito): Securely manages multi-user access. Architecture Overview Users log in via Cognito and interact with the Next.js interface. Actions such as logging or rating trigger API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB workflows. The Bedrock chatbot accesses Personalize results to generate conversational movie suggestions. Amplify hosts the frontend for seamless deployment and scalability. 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases Architecture Design (Month 1): Research AWS serverless and AI integration patterns; finalize architecture diagrams. Prototype Integration (Month 2): Implement Amplify hosting, Cognito authentication, and Lambda-based backend APIs. Recommendation System (Month 3): Connect Personalize and Bedrock for end-to-end AI recommendation and chatbot response. Testing \u0026amp; Deployment: Conduct functional testing, optimize costs, and deploy production-ready version on Amplify. Technical Requirements Frontend: Next.js + React hosted via AWS Amplify, using TMDb API for movie data. Backend: AWS Lambda (Node.js runtime) connected through API Gateway. Database: Amazon DynamoDB for scalable user and review data. AI Components: Amazon Personalize (user-item recommendations) and Bedrock (chatbot dialogue). Authentication: Amazon Cognito for secure, multi-user access. Automation: AWS SDK \u0026amp; CloudFormation for provisioning; AWS SAM for deployment workflows. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Phase Duration Key Deliverables Month 1 Research \u0026amp; Architecture AWS design finalizing Month 2 Core Development Amplify hosting, Cognito setup, Lambda API, DynamoDB schema Month 3 AI Integration \u0026amp; Testing Personalize training, Bedrock chatbot, system deployment Post-Launch Continuous Improvement Cost optimization, new features, UX refinement 6. Budget Estimation Estimated Monthly Cost: $40.09 USD ($481.08 for 12 months)\nThe cost estimate of this project is projected in this link: https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=dab7fb57dabfb76041cdba98ac2bac7ba9630046\nThe monthly cost estimate of $40.09 USD is calculated based on the following specific usage assumptions derived from the AWS Pricing Calculator:\nStandard Usage: Assumes 10,000 requests per month for both AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. User Base: Assumes a maximum of 10,000 Monthly Active Users (MAU) for Amazon Cognito. AI/ML Usage (Primary Cost Driver): Amazon Bedrock is estimated for continuous operation (24 hours per day) with an average of 1 request per minute and 100 input/output tokens per request. Amazon Personalize includes 1 GB of data ingested and 15 training hours per month. Security Overhead: Assumes use of 1 AWS WAF Web ACL with 4 Rules and 3 Managed Rule Groups. Data Storage: Assumes 0.5 GB of data storage in Amazon DynamoDB. 7. Risk Assessment Risk Probability Impact Mitigation API rate limits from TMDb Medium Medium Cache requests via Lambda Model training cost escalation Low Medium Use limited training dataset for testing Chatbot latency Medium Low Optimize Bedrock model type and response size Authentication or token expiry Medium Low Use short-lived JWTs and refresh tokens 8. Expected Outcomes Technical Improvements Demonstrates serverless integration of AI/ML and LLM services in real-world use. Establishes a reusable AWS architecture for recommendation-based apps. Long-Term Value Provides a foundation for future expansion into a social movie discovery network. Serves as an AWS FCJ internship showcase project highlighting scalability, personalization, and conversational AI.

The demos were 100% reproducible (speaker shared GitHub repo immediately). The case-study session with Vietnamese companies was particularly inspiring — proved that local teams can achieve world-class DevOps maturity.\n“This wasn’t a slideware workshop — we built and deployed production-grade pipelines, IaC, containers, and observability in real time.”\nHands down the best AWS DevOps learning experience in 2025 so far.\nEvent photos\n(Add photos: group photo, live demo screenshots, white-boarding sessions, networking, etc.)\nHighly recommend this format to any team serious about modern cloud development!\n"},{"uri":"https://thormastran.github.io/fcj-workshop-template/3-blogstranslated/","title":"Translated Blogs","tags":[],"description":"","content":" ⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference purposes only.
