# Summary Report: "GenAI – Journey from Traditional AI Engineer to Practical GenAI Engineer"


## 1. Participation Objectives
- Understand trends in Generative AI (GenAI) application in enterprises 2025–2026
- Learn the differences between traditional AI Engineers and GenAI Engineers
- Build a skill development roadmap aligned with market demands

## 2. Main Content

### 2.1. Comparison between Traditional AI Engineer and GenAI Engineer

| Criteria | Traditional AI Engineer | GenAI Engineer (2025) |
|----------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Work Objectives** | Build ML models from scratch | Integrate GenAI into enterprise applications |
| **Core Skills** | Math, Statistics, Python, R, ML algorithms | Prompt Engineering, Fine-tuning, Software Engineering |
| **Main Tools** | TensorFlow, PyTorch, Spark | LLM APIs (GPT, Claude), LangChain, Vector DB |
| **Practical Applications** | Long-term research | Quick solutions: chatbots, inventory checks, automation |

**Note:** GenAI Engineer requires strong Software Engineering skills (70%) combined with AI knowledge (30%), focusing on production deployment with low cost, optimal latency, and data security.

### 2.2. GenAI Role in IT
- **Software Developer:** Accelerate coding by 30–50% with AI coding assistants
- **Cloud Engineer:** Automate debugging, log analysis, Infrastructure-as-Code writing
- **Enterprise:** Apply GenAI to real problems like shelf checking, internal chatbots, report summarization

### 2.3. Common Misconceptions about GenAI
- **Prompt Engineering is simple:** Reality requires understanding Context Window, Chain-of-Thought, Few-shot to create stable output
- **GenAI replaces coders:** Wrong, coders who know how to use GenAI will replace those who don't
- **Just calling APIs is enough:** Production requires optimizing latency, cost, and security (RAG, caching, quantization)

### 2.4. First Cloud Journey Introduction
- **Founded:** 2020 (5 years)
- **Achievements:** Trained >5,000 students, helped ~200 people find jobs (mainly Cloud & GenAI)
- **Mission:** Develop Vietnamese technical leaders, contribute to the community

## 3. Value Gained
- Clear understanding that GenAI is mandatory for enterprise projects 2025–2026
- Identified key skills: Software Engineering + Prompt Engineering + Production optimization
- Received learning roadmap from First Cloud Journey to become a practical GenAI Engineer in 6–12 months

## 4. Action Plan (Q1–Q2/2026)
- Improve backend skills (FastAPI, Docker, PostgreSQL)
- Master Prompt Engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Build 1–2 practical GenAI projects (internal chatbot or process automation)
- Learn Fine-tuning (LoRA/QLoRA) and production optimization (vLLM, caching)

## 5. Company Recommendations
- Consider integrating GenAI into internal processes (e.g., HR support chatbot, report automation)
- Train IT team on Prompt Engineering and RAG to increase efficiency
- Leverage internal data to build custom GenAI solutions while ensuring security
