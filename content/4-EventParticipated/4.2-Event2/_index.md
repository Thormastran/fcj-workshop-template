# Summary Report: “AI/ML/GenAI on AWS”

### Event Objectives
- Gain a clear understanding of AWS AI/ML and Generative AI ecosystem
- Hands-on exposure to Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock through live demos
- Master core Generative AI concepts: Prompt Engineering, RAG, Agents, and Guardrails
- Identify quick-win GenAI use cases suitable for Vietnamese enterprises

### Speakers
- AWS Vietnam Team
- AWS Specialist Solutions Architect – Machine Learning
- AWS Senior Specialist Solutions Architect – Generative AI

### Key Highlights

#### Amazon SageMaker – Full-lifecycle ML Platform
- End-to-end workflow: data preparation & labeling → model training & tuning → deployment → monitoring
- SageMaker Studio: the most productive IDE for data scientists and ML engineers today
- Built-in MLOps tools (Feature Store, Model Registry, Pipelines) — no third-party tools required
- Live demo: trained and deployed an image classification model in under 15 minutes

#### Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock (the most practical session)
- Serverless access to leading Foundation Models: Claude 3 (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus), Llama 3, Titan
- Detailed comparison of speed, quality, and cost → clear guidance on model selection
- Advanced Prompt Engineering: Chain-of-Thought, Few-shot, ReAct, Tool Use
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) + Knowledge Bases: the most cost-effective way to ground LLMs with private data
- Bedrock Agents: turn chatbots into autonomous agents that call APIs, query databases, and execute multi-step tasks
- Guardrails: built-in content filtering, brand safety, and compliance controls
- Highlight live demo: built a fully functional enterprise chatbot with RAG + Knowledge Base + Guardrails in ~20 minutes

### Key Takeaways
- Prompt Engineering is the #1 skill for 2025–2026
- RAG is mandatory if you want accurate, hallucination-free answers on your own data
- Bedrock Agents + Tool Integration move GenAI from “cool demo” to real production applications
- Vietnamese companies can now go from idea to production GenAI app in weeks, not months
027- Bedrock pricing is extremely competitive — often cheaper than self-hosting open-source models when infrastructure is factored in

### Applying to Work (Action Plan)
- Next week: start experimenting with Bedrock Playground and SageMaker Studio (Free Tier is sufficient)
- December 2025: run internal Prompt Engineering + RAG workshop for the team
- Q1 2026: pilot at least one internal GenAI project (e.g., HR/policy/product knowledge chatbot using Bedrock + RAG)
- Integrate Amazon Q Developer into daily development workflow for 20–30% productivity gain

### Event Experience
Extremely hands-on and production-focused: ~70% live coding/demo, ~30% Q&A. No fluffy slides — everything shown was reproducible on the spot. The Bedrock demo was mind-blowing: a complete enterprise-ready GenAI application with private data integration built in just 20 minutes — something that used to take teams months.
