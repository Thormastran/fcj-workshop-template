### Next.js Project Setup & Amplify Configuration

In this section, you will set up a **Next.js application**, install the required **Amplify SDK packages**, and configure Amplify to connect your web application to the **Cognito User Pool** created earlier.

You will prepare the base environment that will be used later to build authentication features such as sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and protected routes.
