### Overall Evaluation

---
**1. Working Environment**

The workplace at FCJ is friendly and supportive. Colleagues are always ready to help, even outside normal working hours, which creates a great sense of teamwork. The office is tidy, well-organized, and comfortable, making it easy to stay productive. A small suggestion would be to organize more team-building or social events to help everyone bond even better.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**

My mentor provided clear and detailed guidance while encouraging me to think independently and only stepping in when truly needed. The administrative team was highly efficient with documentation, shared all necessary resources promptly, and made the entire onboarding and daily process seamless.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**

The tasks I was given aligned very well with my field of study, reinforcing the theory I learned in university while introducing fresh, real-world applications and new concepts I hadn’t encountered in class.


**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**

I gained practical skills in areas such as project management tools, effective teamwork, and professional communication. My mentor also offered valuable career advice and real-industry insights that helped me better understand my long-term professional goals.


**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**

The culture is respectful, positive, and nicely balanced between professionalism and approachability. During high-pressure periods, everyone works together collaboratively regardless of position, which made me feel fully part of the team despite being an intern.


**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**

The program offers a monthly stipend, flexible working hours when needed, and access to internal training sessions, all of which add significant value to the experience.

### Additional Questions

**What was the most fulfilling part of your internship experience?**  
The most rewarding aspect was seeing how the theoretical knowledge from my studies directly applied to real projects, combined with the strong support and trust the team placed in me.

**Which aspects do you think the company could improve for future interns?**  
Adding more social or team-building activities would help new interns integrate faster and build stronger relationships with the team.

**If a friend asked, would you recommend this place for an internship? Why or why not?**  
Yes, I would definitely recommend it. The supportive environment, relevant tasks, excellent mentorship, and positive culture make it an outstanding opportunity to learn and grow professionally.

### Suggestions & Expectations


- **Would you like to continue this program in the future?**  
Absolutely — I would be very interested in returning for another internship or even a full-time role after graduation.

- **Any other comments (free sharing):**  
Thank you to the entire FCJ team for such a welcoming and enriching experience. I’ve learned a lot, feel much more confident in my abilities, and truly enjoyed my time here!
