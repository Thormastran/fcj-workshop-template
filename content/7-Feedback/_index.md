### Overall Evaluation

---
**1. Working Environment**

The working environment is warm and welcoming. Everyone at FCJ is approachable and willing to assist whenever I run into difficulties — even beyond regular working hours. The office setup is clean, organized, and comfortable, which helps me stay focused. One thing that could be improved is increasing team-building or social activities to help members connect more.

---
**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**

My mentor gave very clear, thorough explanations and always encouraged me to ask questions whenever I got stuck. The admin team handled paperwork efficiently, shared all the materials I needed, and ensured I had a smooth working experience. What I appreciate the most is that my mentor encourages independent problem-solving instead of giving direct answers right away.

---
**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**

My assigned tasks were closely related to what I studied at school, yet still introduced new topics I hadn’t explored before. This helped reinforce what I already knew while expanding my understanding through practical experience.

---
**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**

Throughout the internship, I had the chance to pick up valuable skills such as using project management tools, collaborating in a team, and communicating professionally in a workplace setting. My mentor also shared practical insights that helped me think more clearly about my future career path.

---
**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**

The workplace culture is very positive: everyone treats each other respectfully and maintains a balance between professionalism and a friendly atmosphere. During tight deadlines, the team collaborates closely and supports one another without considering job titles. This made me feel truly included, even as an intern.

---
**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**

The internship provides a monthly allowance and allows flexible working hours when necessary. Additionally, being able to participate in internal training sessions is a major advantage.
