# AWS gears up for action-packed Gamescom and Devcom 2024

More than 320,000 gamers and games industry professionals are expected to gather in Cologne, Germany, next week as Gamescom gets underway. One of the world’s most anticipated games industry events, the conference brings together developers, publishers, hardware manufacturers, and cloud providers from around the world alongside the gaming community to celebrate industry achievements and discuss the trends shaping the industry’s future.

Historically, it’s also been a forum for launching new game development offerings, making partnership announcements, and debuting compelling technology demos. Devcom, the official game developer event of Gamescom, is an annual highlight, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is preparing to make a splash at both events. Here’s what to expect:

## AWS on-site activities

Aligning purpose-built game development services and solutions from AWS and AWS Partners against six solution areas, including Cloud Game Development, Game Servers, Live Operations, Game Security, Game Analytics, and Game Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), AWS helps developers build, run, and grow their games. AWS is participating in a range of Devcom-related activities inside and outside the Confex Exhibitor Hall, such as:

Live product demonstrations

Visitors to the AWS booth (E2) can check out real-time demos of game industry–specific AWS technology led by industry experts and partners. Among the lineup is a generative AI kiosk featuring Ada, an in-game non-player character (NPC) created with MetaHuman in Unreal Engine 5 and [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/vi/bedrock/), a toolset for building generative AI applications. The demo shows how this technology can make NPCs more dynamic and intelligent to enhance the player experience.

A second demo dives deep into using Stable Diffusion within Amazon Bedrock to generate images for your mood boards, and to seamlessly integrate these generated images into Miro a popular online collaborative whiteboard platform. At the booth, AWS Partners EPAM Systems and Revolgy will also demo solutions for generative AI and cloud game development.
